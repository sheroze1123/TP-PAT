1. Initialize absorption coefficients
    - Initialize with true solution + noise
    - What about application dependent initializations?
2. Solve forward equation and obtain density of photons, u(x)
    - Setup bilinear and linear forms
3. Solve adjoint equation to obtain the adjoint variable
    - Setup bilinear and linear forms
4. Compute objective function and gradients
    - Use Ren nonlinear paper for gradients and objective function
5. Use BFGS to update coefficients using computed gradients
6. Update absorption coefficients and go to 2 until convergence
    - Convergence properties?
